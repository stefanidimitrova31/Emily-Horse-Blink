# Emily-Horse-Blink
This repository hosts all code necessary for the Horse Blink Project.

Setting up:

You need to create a folder on your Desktop called Horseblink. Inside, create three folders: code, videos, data. You want to put this file in the folder called 'code'.
In the videos folder make sure to put all of your Horse videos. The data folder is where the CSV files will be saved once you run the code for a video.
